      <h3>Mudhir Sharif</h3>
      <p>I am studying a Computer Science BSc degree at City, University of London.
	  I decided to study Computer Science because I have many family members who work 
	  in technology and it has always interested me. During A Levels is when my programming
	  journey began as we did projects using Python along with Tkinter and SQL. During my spare
	  time, I enjoy playing sports. My favourite sports are football and basketball. I also
	  really enjoy travelling as I like visitting different countries and experiencing different
	  cultures.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Anime Opening</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This processing project demonstrates an understanding of the use
	of sound, methods, interactions, images, if statements and classes. I created a
	village background by resizing an image to match the size of the sketch. A line is 
	also created on this background where the user will be able to make their player 
	jump(triggering a ninja jump sound effect). There is also an anime soundtrack playing
	in the background for added effect to create the feel of a real anime scene. I added 4 
	different characters that users can choose from using key interactions and if statements.
	Different keys would create a different character to appear on the screen and users can 
	use those keys to make their characters jump and trigger the sound effect. I included all 
	character information inside the Player class to make the code more organised.
